# Swifli: Web Links to Web3 Actions

## What is Swifli?

Swifli is a revolutionary protocol that transforms web links into instant web3 actions, enabling seamless blockchain interactions across all platforms. By encoding complex blockchain operations into simple, shareable URLs, Swifli bridges the gap between traditional web experiences and web3 capabilities. Our platform democratizes access to blockchain technology, making it as easy as clicking a link to perform actions like sending payments, minting NFTs, or executing smart contracts on the Stellar network.

## Features

- **URL Scheme**: Custom URL scheme that encodes web3 actions into standard web links.
- **Stellar Integration**: Leverages Stellar's speed and low fees for efficient blockchain transactions.
- **Astro Frontend**: Slick and responsive user interface built with the Astro framework.
- **Soroban Smart Contracts**: Utilizes Stellar's new smart contract platform for advanced operations like NFT minting.
- **Freighter Wallet Integration**: Seamless user authentication and transaction signing.
